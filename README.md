## **Development of an LMS (Learning Management System)**

# **Campuslands - LMS**

This project is a Learning Management System (LMS) designed to simplify the organization and tracking of tasks and courses. It allows users to log in and view a personalized interface based on their role (student, teacher, or admin).

---

## **Main Features**

* **User Authentication**: Users can log in with credentials to access the platform.
* **Task Management**: A view of assigned tasks with details such as due dates, delivery status (pending, completed, delayed, or late), and grades.
* **User Roles**: The interface dynamically adapts according to the user's role (student, teacher, or admin), displaying the relevant options and content for each.

---

## **Technologies Used**

* **HTML5**: Website structure.
* **CSS3**: Styles and design, including the user interface.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Client-side logic, DOM manipulation, and communication with the API.
* **API Mock**: Uses a simulated service (`mockapi.io`) to manage user, course, and task data.
